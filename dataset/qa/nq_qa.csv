Established pursuant to Article Three of the United States Constitution in 1789, it has ultimate ( and largely discretionary ) appellate jurisdiction over all federal courts and state court cases, involving issues of federal law plus original jurisdiction over a small range of cases.

Once appointed, justices have lifetime tenure unless they resign, retire, or are removed after impeachment ( though no justice has ever been removed ). In modern discourse, the justices are often categorized as having conservative, moderate, or liberal philosophies of law and of judicial interpretation. Each justice has one vote, and it is worth noting that while a far greater number of cases in recent history have been decided unanimously, decisions in cases of the highest profile have often come down to just one single vote, thereby exposing the justices ' ideological beliefs that track with those philosophical or political categories.

For example, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the state and against an individual, as in State of Arizona v. Ernesto Miranda.

It was developed by Larry Gelbart, adapted from the 1970 feature film M * A * S * H, which, in turn, was based on Richard Hooker 's 1968 novel MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors. The series, which was produced with 20th Century Fox Television for CBS, follows a team of doctors and support staff stationed at the `` 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital '' in Uijeongbu, South Korea, during the Korean War ( 1950 -- 53 ). The show 's title sequence features an instrumental - only version of `` Suicide Is Painless '', the original film 's theme song. The show was created after an attempt to film the original book 's sequel, M * A * S * H Goes to Maine, failed. The television series is the best - known of the M * A * S * H works, and one of the highest - rated shows in US television history.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=M*A*S*H_(TV_series)&amp;oldid=857099655

Halley's Comet|4180779124686928529|when was the last time halleys comet came|1986 apparition|Halley 's 1986 apparition was the least favourable on record. The comet and Earth were on opposite sides of the Sun in February 1986, creating the worst viewing circumstances for Earth observers for the last 2,000 years. Halley 's closest approach was 0.42 AU. Additionally, with increased light pollution from urbanization, many people failed to even see the comet. It was possible to observe it in areas outside of cities with the help of binoculars. Further, the comet appeared brightest when it was almost invisible from the northern hemisphere in March and April. Halley 's approach was first detected by astronomers David Jewitt and G. Edward Danielson on 16 October 1982 using the 5.1 m Hale telescope at Mount Palomar and a CCD camera. The first person to visually observe the comet on its 1986 return was amateur astronomer Stephen James O'Meara on 24 January 1985. O'Meara used a home - built 24 - inch telescope on top of Mauna Kea to detect the magnitude 19.6 comet. On 8 November 1985, Stephen Edberg ( then serving as the Coordinator for Amateur Observations at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ) and Charles Morris were the first to observe Halley 's Comet with the naked eye in its 1986 apparition.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Halley%27s_Comet&amp;oldid=843089967

Its orbit around the Sun is highly elliptical, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.967 ( with 0 being a circle and 1 being a parabolic trajectory ). The perihelion, the point in the comet 's orbit when it is nearest the Sun, is just 0.6 AU. This is between the orbits of Mercury and Venus. Its aphelion, or farthest distance from the Sun, is 35 AU ( roughly the distance of Pluto ). Unusual for an object in the Solar System, Halley 's orbit is retrograde; it orbits the Sun in the opposite direction to the planets, or, clockwise from above the Sun 's north pole. The orbit is inclined by 18 ° to the ecliptic, with much of it lying south of the ecliptic. ( Because it is retrograde, the true inclination is 162 ° ). Due to the retrograde orbit, it has one of the highest velocities relative to the Earth of any object in the Solar System. The 1910 passage was at a relative velocity of 70.56 km / s ( 157,838 mph or 254,016 km / h ). Because its orbit comes close to Earth 's in two places, Halley is associated with two meteor showers: the Eta Aquariids in early May, and the Orionids in late October. Halley is the parent body to the Orionids. Observations conducted around the time of Halley 's appearance in 1986 suggested that the comet could additionally perturb the Eta Aquarid meteor shower, although it might not be the parent of that shower.

Subaru Tribeca|2709075994370906560|does the subaru tribeca have a third row||Subaru released the 2008 models at the New York International Auto Show in April 2007 with a facelift and a larger 3.6 - liter EZ36 flat - six engine rated at 191 kilowatts ( 256 hp ). Subaru claimed 10 percent better fuel economy while using regular - grade gasoline; the 2006 and 2007 models require premium. At the same time, Subaru dropped the `` B9 '' identifier, renaming the vehicle the `` Subaru Tribeca '' in all markets where it was offered. The rear of the vehicle was also mildly redesigned with more rounded taillamps, a restyled hatch, and the rearmost side window reshaped. Interior styling was unchanged, but the second row seats were redesigned for more room and easier access to the third row.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Subaru_Tribeca&amp;oldid=806905578

Hawaii|8755584773268996464|which group in hawail was in favor of annexation by the united states||After William McKinley won the 1896 U.S. presidential election, advocates pressed to annex the Republic of Hawaii. The previous president, Grover Cleveland, was a friend of Queen Lili ʻuokalani. McKinley was open to persuasion by U.S. expansionists and by annexationists from Hawai ʻi. He met with three annexationists: Lorrin A. Thurston, Francis March Hatch and William Ansel Kinney. After negotiations in June 1897, Secretary of State John Sherman agreed to a treaty of annexation with these representatives of the Republic of Hawaii. The U.S. Senate never ratified the treaty. Despite the opposition of most native Hawaiians, the Newlands Resolution was used to annex the Republic to the U.S.; it became the Territory of Hawaii. The Newlands Resolution was passed by the House on June 15, 1898, by 209 votes in favor to 91 against, and by the Senate on July 6, 1898, by a vote of 42 to 21.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Hawaii&amp;oldid=817707932

America's Got Talent|3984434816122104588|what does the red x mean on america's got talent||Following the producers ' auditions, acts audition in front of ( as of 2013 ) four celebrity judges. These auditions are held in theaters in various cities nationally and are later televised. Judges may individually register their disapproval of an act by pressing a red buzzer, which lights up their corresponding X above the stage. Any performer who receives X 's ( 3 from season 1 - 7, or 4 from season 8 - ) from the judges must stop performing and is eliminated. Since season three ( 2008 ), large audiences have also been a factor in the judging process, as their reaction to an act 's performance may swing or influence a judge 's vote. If an act receives three or more `` yes '' votes, they advance to the next round of competition.

It is part of the global Got Talent franchise created by Simon Cowell, and is produced by FremantleMedia North America and SYCOtv, with distribution done by Freemantle. Since its premiere in June 2006, each season is run during the network 's summer schedule, with the show having featured various hosts - it is currently hosted by Tyra Banks, since 2017. It is the first global edition of the franchise, after plans for a British edition in 2005 were suspended, following a dispute between Paul O'Grady, the planned host, and the British broadcaster ITV; production of this edition later resumed in 2007.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=America%27s_Got_Talent&amp;oldid=857086269
America's Got Talent|6985714217179907107|where is america's got talent auditions held|in various cities across the United States.|The general selection process of each season is begun by the production team with open auditions held in various cities across the United States. Dubbed `` Producers ' Auditions '', they are held months before the main stage of auditions are held. Those that make it through the initial stage, become participants in the `` Judges ' Auditions '', which are held in select cities across the country, and attended by the judges. Each participant is held offstage and awaits their turn to perform before the judges, whereupon they are given 90 seconds to demonstrate their act, with a live audience present for all performances. At the end of a performance, the judges give constructive criticism and feedback about what they saw, whereupon they each give a vote - a participant who receives a majority vote approving their performance, moves on to the next stage, otherwise they are eliminated from the programme at that stage. Each judge is given a buzzer, and may use it during a performance if they are unimpressed, hate what is being performed, or feel the act is a waste of their time; if a participant is buzzed by all judges, their performance is automatically over and they are eliminated without being given a vote. Many acts that move on may be cut by producers and may forfeit due to the limited slots available for the second performance. Filming for each season always takes place when the Judges ' Auditions are taking place, with the show 's presenter standing in the wings of each venue 's stage to interview and give personal commentary on a participant 's performance.

Further changes were made to the panel and show 's host, as a direct result of each respective member having a need to focus on other TV commitments - Springer was forced to leave after the third season, and was replaced by Nick Cannon for the fourth season; Hasselhoff left the show after the fourth season, and so was replaced by Howie Mandel for the fifth season as a direct result; Morgan left after the sixth season, leading to him being replaced by Howard Stern for the seventh season.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=America%27s_Got_Talent&amp;oldid=857086269

These auditions are held in theaters in various cities nationally and are later televised. Judges may individually register their disapproval of an act by pressing a red buzzer, which lights up their corresponding X above the stage. Any performer who receives X 's ( 3 in seasons 1 to 7, or 4 from season 8 onwards ) from the judges must stop performing and is eliminated. Since season three ( 2008 ), large audiences have also been a factor in the judging process, as their reaction to an act 's performance may swing or influence a judge 's vote. If an act receives three or more `` yes '' votes, they advance to the next round of competition. However, in the majority of seasons, several acts do not perform in the second round and are immediately sent home by the judges without a second performance.

Tears in Heaven|1256961689769255717|what is eric clapton's tears in heaven about||The years following 1990 were extremely turbulent for Clapton. In August 1990, his manager, two of his roadies and his friend and fellow musician Stevie Ray Vaughan were killed in a helicopter accident. Seven months later, on March 20, 1991, Clapton 's 4 - year - old son Conor died after falling from the 53rd - floor window of his mother 's friend 's New York City apartment. He landed on the roof of an adjacent four - story building. After isolating himself for a period, Clapton began working again, writing music for a movie about drug addiction called Rush. Clapton dealt with the grief of his son 's death by co-writing `` Tears in Heaven '' with Will Jennings. Shortly after his single was released, he went on to the MTV Unplugged series and recorded a new version of the song. Unplugged topped charts and was nominated for nine Grammy Awards the year it was released. Clapton made numerous public service announcements to raise awareness for childproofing windows and staircases.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Tears_in_Heaven&amp;oldid=843654652

Harry is now working in a desk job as the Head of Magical Law Enforcement at the Ministry of Magic, while Ginny is the editor of the sports section of the Daily Prophet. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger also send their daughter Rose Granger - Weasley, on the train. Hermione is now Minister for Magic, while Ron manages Weasley 's Wizard Wheezes in Diagon Alley. Albus makes an unlikely friend in Slytherin with Scorpius Malfoy, the son of Harry 's unknown friend Draco Malfoy and Astoria Kolfrey. Surprisingly, Albus is sorted into Slytherin house alongside Scorpius, as all Potters before him were sorted into Gryffindor. Both boys are bullied by other students over the next few years, Albus due to his perceived failure to live up to his parents, Scorpius due to unproven rumours that he is the son of Lord Voldemort. In addition, Albus and Harry begin to drift apart, owing to Albus 's struggles with his father 's shadow, and Harry 's uncertainty on how to deal with his son 's issues. Albus also drifts apart from Rose, who he was friends with before meeting Scorpius. Prior to Albus and Scorpius 's fourth year, Albus gets into a fight with his father after he is given Harry 's baby blanket and a love potion from Ron. During the fight, Harry accidentally says that he does not love Albus, and Albus spills the potion on the blanket.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Harry_Potter_and_the_Cursed_Child&amp;oldid=802499021

With European nations not allowed to host after the previous World Cup in Spain, Colombia had been originally chosen to host the competition by FIFA but, largely due to economic reasons, was not able to do so and officially resigned in 1982. Mexico was selected as the new host in May 1983.

Jose Brown put Argentina one up midway through the first half of the final, and when Jorge Valdano scored a second for the South Americans in the 55th minute, Argentina looked to be strolling to victory. West Germany then staged a spirited comeback. Karl - Heinz Rummenigge pulled one back in the 74th minute, and six minutes later Rudi Völler hit the equaliser. With seven minutes remaining, a pass from Maradona gave Jorge Burruchaga the chance to score the winner for Argentina.

Standard deviation|4237044126565974189|what does it mean to be one standard deviation below the mean||If the population of interest is approximately normally distributed, the standard deviation provides information on the proportion of observations above or below certain values. For example, the average height for adult men in the United States is about 70 inches ( 177.8 cm ), with a standard deviation of around 3 inches ( 7.62 cm ). This means that most men ( about 68 %, assuming a normal distribution ) have a height within 3 inches ( 7.62 cm ) of the mean ( 67 -- 73 inches ( 170.18 -- 185.42 cm ) ) -- one standard deviation -- and almost all men ( about 95 % ) have a height within 6 inches ( 15.24 cm ) of the mean ( 64 -- 76 inches ( 162.56 -- 193.04 cm ) ) -- two standard deviations. If the standard deviation were zero, then all men would be exactly 70 inches ( 177.8 cm ) tall. If the standard deviation were 20 inches ( 50.8 cm ), then men would have much more variable heights, with a typical range of about 50 -- 90 inches ( 127 -- 228.6 cm ). Three standard deviations account for 99.7 % of the sample population being studied, assuming the distribution is normal ( bell - shaped ). ( See the 68 - 95 - 99.7 rule, or the empirical rule, for more information. )|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Standard_deviation&amp;oldid=850069590

Standard deviation|-1410490605946280817|the standard deviation of all possible values is called the||In addition to expressing the variability of a population, the standard deviation is commonly used to measure confidence in statistical conclusions. For example, the margin of error in polling data is determined by calculating the expected standard deviation in the results if the same poll were to be conducted multiple times. This derivation of a standard deviation is often called the `` standard error '' of the estimate or `` standard error of the mean '' when referring to a mean. It is computed as the standard deviation of all the means that would be computed from that population if an infinite number of samples were drawn and a mean for each sample were computed. It is very important to note that the standard deviation of a population and the standard error of a statistic derived from that population ( such as the mean ) are quite different but related ( related by the inverse of the square root of the number of observations ). The reported margin of error of a poll is computed from the standard error of the mean ( or alternatively from the product of the standard deviation of the population and the inverse of the square root of the sample size, which is the same thing ) and is typically about twice the standard deviation -- the half - width of a 95 percent confidence interval. In science, researchers commonly report the standard deviation of experimental data, and only effects that fall much farther than two standard deviations away from what would have been expected are considered statistically significant -- normal random error or variation in the measurements is in this way distinguished from likely genuine effects or associations. The standard deviation is also important in finance, where the standard deviation on the rate of return on an investment is a measure of the volatility of the investment.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Standard_deviation&amp;oldid=795466356

After singing the lyrics, he decided that he liked how sad the song sounded, when Robson suggested that it be recorded in a higher key to sound more emotional.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=What_Hurts_the_Most&amp;oldid=825976858

The club next returned to the SANFL Grand Final in 2017, though once more fell at the final hurdle, being defeated by Sturt by just one point.

During the 19th century, Australian football competition adopted the approach that the team on top of the ladder at the end of the home - and - away series was declared the premiers. However, the fledgling VFL decided that a finals series played between the top four teams at the end of the season would generate more interest and gate money. For 1897, the VFL scheduled a round robin tournament whereby the top four played each other once and the team that won the most matches was declared the winner.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=AFL_Grand_Final&amp;oldid=815474207

Bonds was initially chased closely by Sosa and Luis Gonzalez of the Arizona Diamondbacks, but Gonzalez faded late and finished with 57, while Sosa finished closer with 64 to become the first player to exceed 60 home runs in three separate seasons. McGwire was not a factor during what would be his final major league season, as the injuries that had plagued him for much of his career finally took their toll, although he still hit at a pace that would have put him near 50 if he had played a full season.

Stone (unit)|801359969631927556|where do they use stones to measure weight||England and other Germanic - speaking countries of northern Europe formerly used various standardised `` stones '' for trade, with their values ranging from about 5 to 40 local pounds ( roughly 3 to 15 kg ) depending on the location and objects weighed. The United Kingdom 's imperial system adopted the wool stone of 14 pounds in 1835. With the advent of metrication, Europe 's various `` stones '' were superseded by or adapted to the kilogram from the mid-19th century on. The stone continues in customary use in Britain and Ireland used for measuring body weight, but was prohibited for commercial use in the UK by the Weights and Measures Act of 1985.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Stone_(unit)&amp;oldid=797735388

There was no standardised `` stone '' in the ancient Jewish world, but in Roman times stone weights were crafted to multiples of the Roman pound.

The correct plural form of stone in this context is stone ( as in, `` 11 stone '' or `` 12 stone 6 pounds '' ); in other contexts, the correct plural is stones ( as in, `` Please enter your weight in stones and pounds '' ).

Economic growth|8687723302253803620|why is gdp/capita not a sufficient measure of success of a nation|all countries have the same steady state rate of growth.|In the Solow - Swan model if productivity increases through technological progress, then output / worker increases even when the economy is in the steady state. If productivity increases at a constant rate, output / worker also increases at a related steady - state rate. As a consequence, growth in the model can occur either by increasing the share of GDP invested or through technological progress. But at whatever share of GDP invested, capital / worker eventually converges on the steady state, leaving the growth rate of output / worker determined only by the rate of technological progress. As a consequence, with world technology available to all and progressing at a constant rate, all countries have the same steady state rate of growth. Each country has a different level of GDP / worker determined by the share of GDP it invests, but all countries have the same rate of economic growth. Implicitly in this model rich countries are those that have invested a high share of GDP for a long time. Poor countries can become rich by increasing the share of GDP they invest. One important prediction of the model, mostly borne out by the data, is that of conditional convergence; the idea that poor countries will grow faster and catch up with rich countries as long as they have similar investment ( and saving ) rates and access to the same technology.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Economic_growth&amp;oldid=800953730

By Early Modern English, many nouns were capitalized, and the earth became ( and often remained ) the Earth, particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies. More recently, the name is sometimes simply given as Earth, by analogy with the names of the other planets. House styles now vary: Oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant.

Another notable and somewhat unique user of the quarter system is Baylor Law School: it operates on the quarter system while the remaining colleges of Baylor University operate on the semester system.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Academic_term&amp;oldid=846222599

Academic term|-7720217515278294216|when does fall session start in us universities|the day after Labor Day in September to|The semester system divides the calendar year into two semesters of 16 to 18 weeks each, plus summer sessions of varying lengths. The two semesters together constitute 32 to 36 weeks of instruction, so that three academic quarters equal two academic semesters. Thus, academic credit earned in quarter hours converts to semester hours at 2⁄3 of its value, while credit earned in semester hours converts to quarter hours at 3 / 2 of its value. Put another way, 3 quarter hours is 2 semester hours. Most universities on the semester system have a fall semester from the day after Labor Day in September to mid-December, a spring / winter semester from late January to early May, and an optional summer session.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Academic_term&amp;oldid=807892126
Academic term|2142214063776378175|when does the university year end in canada|the Thursday before the last Friday in June.|Generally in English Canada, high schools run on a two - semester arrangement, also known as fall and spring semester, the first semester starting from the day after Labour Day in September to mid-January and the second running from early February until the Thursday before the last Friday in June. The semesters are often divided into two terms each. Some schools in Canada run on a trimester system, the first running from September to January, the second from January to March or April, and the third from March or April until June. The trimester is more common in elementary and middle schools ( Kindergarten - Grade 8 ) than in high schools ( Grade 9 - Grade 12 ). Most of those characteristics differ in Québec, where education is, with the exception of a few school boards, given in French. By tradition, Quebec and Franco - Ontarian elementary and secondary schools will arrange timetables to ensure the school year ends before June 24, date of the St - Jean - Baptiste day celebration, a traditional holiday.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Academic_term&amp;oldid=843581819

Lionel Messi|6695821326812052451|when did lionel messi started his football career|2002.|After a year at Barcelona 's youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation ( RFEF ) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc Fàbregas and Gerard Piqué. After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14, Messi became an integral part of the `` Baby Dream Team '', Barcelona 's greatest - ever youth side. During his first full season ( 2002 -- 03 ), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups. The Copa Catalunya final, a 4 -- 1 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la máscara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution. At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while Fàbregas and Piqué soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Lionel_Messi&amp;oldid=833154570

Lionel Messi|6979025820584532396|when did messi started playing in la liga||As the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin. In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club 's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell 's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Lionel_Messi&amp;oldid=807310327

At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left - footed dribbler drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who declared the teenager his successor. After making his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup during the 2006 edition, and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the tournament.

However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, at age 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father 's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $ 1,000 per month, Newell 's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise. He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker, Pablo Aimar, he idolised, but they were also unable to pay for his treatment due to the country 's economic collapse.

His style of play as a diminutive, left - footed dribbler drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who declared the teenager his successor. After making his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup during the 2006 edition, and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the tournament.

During the six years he played for Newell 's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of `` The Machine of ' 87 '', the near - unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half - time of the first team 's home games. However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, at age 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father 's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $ 1,000 per month, Newell 's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise. He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker, Pablo Aimar, he idolised, but they were also unable to pay for his treatment due to the country 's economic collapse.

After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games. Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French Winger Ludovic Giuly explained how a teenage Leo caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard 's first team: `` He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the team 's starting centre - backs were nervous. He was an alien. '' At 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, he made his first team debut when he came on in the 75th minute during a friendly against José Mourinho 's Porto on 16 November 2003. His performance, creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily with the club 's reserve side, Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team. After his first training session with the senior squad, Barça 's new star player, Ronaldinho, told his teammates that he believed the 16 - year - old would become an even better player than himself. Ronaldinho soon befriended Messi, whom he called `` little brother '', which greatly eased his transition into the first team.

Growing altitudes range between 1,000 m ( 3,300 ft ) to 1,500 m ( 4,900 ft ) above sea level for Arabica ( premier coffee ), and 500 m ( 1,600 ft ) to 1,000 m ( 3,300 ft ) for Robusta ( though of lower quality, it is robust to environment conditions ). Ideally, both Arabica and Robusta are planted in well drained soil conditions that favour rich organic matter that is slightly acidic ( pH 6.0 -- 6.5 ). However, India 's coffees tend to be moderately acidic which can lead to either a balanced and sweet taste, or a listless and inert one. Slopes of Arabica tend to be gentle to moderate, while Robusta slopes are gentle to fairly level.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Coffee_production_in_India&amp;oldid=795343925

Stolen in 1791, it was recut, with the largest section acquiring its `` Hope '' name when it appeared in the catalogue of a gem collection owned by a London banking family called Hope in 1839.

The Hope Diamond is the most popular jewel on display and the collection 's centerpiece. In 1988, specialists with the Gemological Institute of America graded it and noticed `` evidence of wear '' and its `` remarkably strong phosphorescence '' with its clarity `` slightly affected by a whitish graining which is common to blue diamonds. '' A highly sensitive colorimeter found tiny traces of a `` very slight violet component '' which is imperceptible to normal vision.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Hope_Diamond&amp;oldid=839602384
Hope Diamond|8307605129512563222|which famous gem was said to have been stolen from a hindu statue|the Hope Diamond was|According to specious accounts in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the original form of the Hope Diamond was stolen from an eye of a sculpted statue of the goddess Sita, the wife of Rama, the seventh Avatar of Vishnu. However, much like the `` curse of Tutankhamun '', this general type of `` legend '' was most likely the invention of Western authors during the Victorian era, and the specific legends about the Hope Diamond 's `` cursed origin '' were invented in the early 20th century to add mystique to the stone and increase its sales appeal as well as increase newspaper sales. It fueled speculation that humans possessing the gemstone were fated to have bad luck with varying reports of undetermined veracity. A report in 2006 in The New York Times, however, suggested that `` any hard evidence linking it to tragedy has yet to be officially proven.

Greta Garbo|-2622027861969344804|who was famous for saying i want to be alone||Because Garbo was suspicious and mistrustful of the media, and often at odds with MGM executives, she spurned Hollywood 's publicity rules. She was routinely referred to by the press as the `` Swedish Sphinx. '' Her reticence and fear of strangers perpetuated the mystery and mystique that she projected both on screen and in real life. MGM eventually capitalized on it, for it bolstered the image of the silent and reclusive woman of mystery. In spite of her strenuous efforts to avoid publicity, Garbo paradoxically became one of the twentieth century 's most publicized women in the world. She is closely associated with a line from Grand Hotel, one which the American Film Institute in 2005 voted the 30th-most memorable movie quote of all time, `` I want to be alone; I just want to be alone. '' The theme was a running gag that began during the period of her silent movies.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Greta_Garbo&amp;oldid=856204268

She never signed autographs or answered fan mail, and rarely gave interviews. Nor did she ever appear at Oscar ceremonies, even when she was nominated. Her aversion to publicity and the press was undeniably genuine, and exasperating to the studio at first. In an interview in 1928, she explained that her desire for privacy began when she was a child, stating `` as early as I can remember, I have wanted to be alone. I detest crowds, do n't like many people. ''|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Greta_Garbo&amp;oldid=806779433

In December 1957, the boys began to sing in harmony. The story is told that they were going to lip sync to a record in the local Gaumont cinema ( as other children had done on previous weeks ), but as they were running to the theatre, the fragile shellac 78 - RPM record broke. The brothers had to sing live and received such a positive response from the audience that they decided to pursue a singing career. In May 1958, the Rattlesnakes were disbanded when Frost and Horrocks left, so the Gibb brothers then formed Wee Johnny Hayes and the Blue Cats, with Barry as Johnny Hayes.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Bee_Gees&amp;oldid=854301335

The young brothers began performing to raise pocket money. They were introduced to leading Brisbane radio DJ Bill Gates by speedway promoter and driver Bill Goode, who had hired the brothers to entertain the crowd at the Redcliffe Speedway in 1960. The crowd at the speedway would throw money onto the track for the boys, who generally performed during the interval of meetings ( usually on the back of a truck that drove around the track ), and in a deal with Goode, any money they collected from the crowd they were allowed to keep. Gates renamed them the BGs ( later changed to `` Bee Gees '' ) after his, Goode 's and Barry Gibb 's initials.

Bee Gees|2391875290968611084|where were the bee gees born and raised||Born on the Isle of Man to English parents, the Gibb brothers lived in Chorlton, Manchester, England, until the late 1950s. There, in 1955, they formed the Rattlesnakes. The family then moved to Redcliffe, in Queensland, Australia, and then to Cribb Island. After achieving their first chart success in Australia as the Bee Gees with `` Spicks and Specks '' ( their 12th single ), they returned to the UK in January 1967, when producer Robert Stigwood began promoting them to a worldwide audience.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Bee_Gees&amp;oldid=818343922
Bee Gees|178294368456690987|why did the bee gees get their name||In August 1958, the Gibb family, including older sister Lesley and infant brother Andy, emigrated to Redcliffe, just north - east of Brisbane in Queensland, Australia. The young brothers began performing to raise pocket money. They were introduced to leading Brisbane radio DJ Bill Gates by speedway promoter and driver Bill Goode, who had hired the brothers to entertain the crowd at the Redcliffe Speedway in 1960. The crowd at the speedway would throw money onto the track for the boys, who generally performed during the interval of meetings ( usually on the back of a truck that drove around the track ), and in a deal with Goode, any money they collected from the crowd they were allowed to keep. Gates renamed them the BG 's ( later changed to `` Bee Gees '' ) after his ( Goode 's ) and Barry Gibb 's initials -- thus the name was not specifically a reference to `` Brothers Gibb '', despite popular belief.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Bee_Gees&amp;oldid=803465776

Bee Gees|1668359715335116313|who wrote most of the bee gees songs||The Bee Gees were a pop music group formed in 1958. Their lineup consisted of brothers Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb. The trio were successful for most of their decades of recording music, but they had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a popular music act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as prominent performers of the disco music era in the mid-to - late 1970s. The group sang recognisable three - part tight harmonies; Robin 's clear vibrato lead vocals were a hallmark of their earlier hits, while Barry 's R&B falsetto became their signature sound during the mid-to - late 1970s and 1980s. The Bee Gees wrote all of their own hits, as well as writing and producing several major hits for other artists.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Bee_Gees&amp;oldid=815317592

Daniel Craig|-9023959601466461190|which was daniel craig's second james bond film|Quantum of Solace followed|Craig 's appearances in the British television film Love Is the Devil: Study for a Portrait of Francis Bacon ( 1998 ), the indie war film The Trench ( 1999 ), and the drama Some Voices ( 2000 ) attracted the film industry 's attention. This led to roles in bigger productions such as the action film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider ( 2001 ), the crime thriller Road to Perdition ( 2002 ), the crime thriller Layer Cake ( 2004 ), and the Steven Spielberg historical drama Munich ( 2005 ). Craig achieved international fame when chosen as the sixth actor to play the role of Ian Fleming 's James Bond in the official film series, taking over from Pierce Brosnan in 2005. Although his casting was initially greeted with scepticism, his debut was highly acclaimed and earned him a BAFTA award nomination, with Casino Royale becoming the highest - grossing in the series at the time.

He made an uncredited cameo appearance as a Stormtrooper in the Star Wars sequel Star Wars: The Force Awakens in 2015. Craig appeared in a modern production of William Shakespeare 's tragedy Othello at the Off - Broadway New York Theatre Workshop throughout late 2016 and early 2017. The production starred David Oyelowo as the titular character and Craig as the main antagonist, Iago. Diane Snyder of The Daily Telegraph praised his `` chilling '' portrayal of Iago in the play. In 2017, Craig co-starred in Steven Soderbergh 's comedy Logan Lucky, about two brothers who pull off a heist during a NASCAR race. Craig starred alongside Halle Berry in the drama Kings set during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. The film premiered in September 2017, but has not yet received distribution. In April 2018, Daniel Craig confirmed to Associated Press that the untitled 25th James Bond film will be his next project, serving as his fifth and final performance as the eponymous character. The film will be directed by Danny Boyle, and is scheduled for a North American release on 8 November 2019, with a traditional earlier release in the United Kingdom and overseas territories.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 656.3 square miles ( 1,700 km ); this comprises 634.0 square miles ( 1,642 km ) of land and 22.3 square miles ( 58 km ) covered by water. The Piney Woods are north of Houston. Most of Houston is located on the gulf coastal plain, and its vegetation is classified as temperate grassland and forest. Much of the city was built on forested land, marshes, swamp, or prairie which resembles the Deep South, and are all still visible in surrounding areas. The flatness of the local terrain, when combined with urban sprawl, has made flooding a recurring problem for the city. Downtown stands about 50 feet ( 15 m ) above sea level, and the highest point in far northwest Houston is about 125 feet ( 38 m ) in elevation. The city once relied on groundwater for its needs, but land subsidence forced the city to turn to ground - level water sources such as Lake Houston, Lake Conroe, and Lake Livingston. The city owns surface water rights for 1.20 billion gallons of water a day in addition to 150 million gallons a day of groundwater.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Houston&amp;oldid=800619736

It serves as the home ballpark for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball ( MLB ). The $2.3 billion stadium, built with $1.2 billion in public subsidies, replaced the original Yankee Stadium in 2009. It is located one block north of the original, on the 24 - acre former site of Macombs Dam Park; the 8 - acre site of the original stadium is now a public park called Heritage Field. The stadium incorporates replicas of some design elements from the original Yankee Stadium, and like its predecessor, it has hosted additional events, including college football games, soccer matches, two outdoor NHL games, and concerts. Although Yankee Stadium 's construction began in August 2006, the project spanned many years and faced many controversies, including the high public cost and the loss of public parkland. The overall price tag makes the new Yankee Stadium the most expensive stadium ever built.

Since the 1980s, the game has been held roughly once every three or four years at a site other than Philadelphia. In addition to the Rose Bowl, these sites have included Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey ( replaced in 2010 by MetLife Stadium, which is scheduled to host the game for the first time in 2021 ), M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore and FedExField in Landover, Maryland. These are still considered neutral - site games, but provide locations that are closer to one academy or the other.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Army%E2%80%93Navy_Game&amp;oldid=824858327

Alibi projects inanimate holograms of herself, which expose the location of any enemy that interacts with the hologram with their weapons, body, or drone; Maestro can install a wall - mounted directed - energy turret that he can then operate remotely, damaging enemies with rapid laser fire. After a certain number of shots, the turret can overheat and has to cool down. Operation Grim Sky - Season 3 September 4, 2018 This DLC introduces two new operators and the first full map redesign for Hereford Base. The first new operator is an attacker named Maverick who uses a small handheld blowtorch to open new lines of sight as well as kill holes, even in reinforced walls to aid the attackers in breaching the objective. The second new operator is a defender called Clash who is the first shield wielding defender. Her shield is similar to Montagne except she utilises technology designed by Mira and Twitch within her gadget; the CCE or Crowd Control Electro Shield. It emits an electric field that slows and damages attackers.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Tom_Clancy%27s_Rainbow_Six_Siege&amp;oldid=866524237

Until the tenth series, live episodes were broadcast from The Fountain Studios in Wembley, the same site used for The X Factor, but following its closure in 2016, the show relocated its live episodes to Elstree Studios in 2017, before moving to Hammersmith Apollo the following year. Like the Audition stage of the contest, each semi-finalist must attempt to impress by primarily conducting a new routine of their act within the same span of time; the judges can still use a buzzer if they are displeased with a performance and can end it early if all the buzzers are used, along with giving a personal opinion about an act when the performance is over. Of the semi-finalists that take part, only two can progress into the final, which is determined by two different types of votes - a public phone vote, and a judges ' vote.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Britain%27s_Got_Talent&amp;oldid=850360607

That categorization is the subject of some debate about where on the BMI scale the dividing lines between categories should be placed. Commonly accepted BMI ranges are underweight: under 18.5 kg / m, normal weight: 18.5 to 25, overweight: 25 to 30, obese: over 30. People of Asian descent have different associations between BMI, percentage of body fat, and health risks than those of European descent, with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease at BMIs lower than the WHO cut - off point for overweight, 25 kg / m, although the cutoff for observed risk varies among different Asian populations.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Body_mass_index&amp;oldid=865858212

San Diego|1792669352164877656|where does the name san diego come from||The first European to visit the region was explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, sailing under the flag of Castile but possibly born in Portugal. Sailing his flagship San Salvador from Navidad, New Spain, Cabrillo claimed the bay for the Spanish Empire in 1542, and named the site `` San Miguel ''. In November 1602, Sebastián Vizcaíno was sent to map the California coast. Arriving on his flagship San Diego, Vizcaíno surveyed the harbor and what are now Mission Bay and Point Loma and named the area for the Catholic Saint Didacus, a Spaniard more commonly known as San Diego de Alcalá. On November 12, 1602, the first Christian religious service of record in Alta California was conducted by Friar Antonio de la Ascensión, a member of Vizcaíno 's expedition, to celebrate the feast day of San Diego.

Speed of light|-3485644205655804127|who discovered that light is faster than sound|Abū Rayhān al - Bīrūnī agreed|Empedocles ( c. 490 -- 430 BC ) was the first to propose a theory of light and claimed that light has a finite speed. He maintained that light was something in motion, and therefore must take some time to travel. Aristotle argued, to the contrary, that `` light is due to the presence of something, but it is not a movement ''. Euclid and Ptolemy advanced Empedocles ' emission theory of vision, where light is emitted from the eye, thus enabling sight. Based on that theory, Heron of Alexandria argued that the speed of light must be infinite because distant objects such as stars appear immediately upon opening the eyes. Early Islamic philosophers initially agreed with the Aristotelian view that light had no speed of travel. In 1021, Alhazen ( Ibn al - Haytham ) published the Book of Optics, in which he presented a series of arguments dismissing the emission theory of vision in favour of the now accepted intromission theory, in which light moves from an object into the eye. This led Alhazen to propose that light must have a finite speed, and that the speed of light is variable, decreasing in denser bodies. He argued that light is substantial matter, the propagation of which requires time, even if this is hidden from our senses. Also in the 11th century, Abū Rayhān al - Bīrūnī agreed that light has a finite speed, and observed that the speed of light is much faster than the speed of sound.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Speed_of_light&amp;oldid=797833559

Speed of light|-2556847133148939809|velocity of light is minimum in which medium||The phase velocity is important in determining how a light wave travels through a material or from one material to another. It is often represented in terms of a refractive index. The refractive index of a material is defined as the ratio of c to the phase velocity v in the material: larger indices of refraction indicate lower speeds. The refractive index of a material may depend on the light 's frequency, intensity, polarization, or direction of propagation; in many cases, though, it can be treated as a material - dependent constant. The refractive index of air is approximately 1.0003. Denser media, such as water, glass, and diamond, have refractive indexes of around 1.3, 1.5 and 2.4, respectively, for visible light. In exotic materials like Bose -- Einstein condensates near absolute zero, the effective speed of light may be only a few metres per second. However, this represents absorption and re-radiation delay between atoms, as do all slower - than - c speeds in material substances. As an extreme example of light `` slowing '' in matter, two independent teams of physicists claimed to bring light to a `` complete standstill '' by passing it through a Bose -- Einstein condensate of the element rubidium, one team at Harvard University and the Rowland Institute for Science in Cambridge, Mass., and the other at the Harvard -- Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, also in Cambridge. However, the popular description of light being `` stopped '' in these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states of atoms, then re-emitted at an arbitrarily later time, as stimulated by a second laser pulse. During the time it had `` stopped, '' it had ceased to be light. This type of behaviour is generally microscopically true of all transparent media which `` slow '' the speed of light.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Speed_of_light&amp;oldid=845243532

Into the Woods|2140831692219111004|who is the mysterious man in into the woods|the Baker 's father.|Cinderella, returning from the last night of the festival, describes how the Prince had spread pitch on the stairs to prevent her from escaping. Caught between wanting to escape and wanting to stay, she eventually resolves to let the Prince decide, leaving him one of her slippers as a clue to her identity ( `` On the Steps of the Palace '' ). The Baker 's Wife frantically tries to convince her to give up her other shoe, offering her the sixth magic bean in exchange for it. Cinderella throws the bean aside, but trades shoes with the Baker 's Wife and flees, while unbeknownst to anyone a second beanstalk starts to grow. The Baker arrives with another cow; they now have all four items. The Prince 's Steward grabs the slipper from the Baker 's Wife, and they are fighting over it when a great crash is heard and Jack 's mother runs in to report that a Giant seeking revenge from Jack for stealing his magic harp has fallen from the first beanstalk when Jack chopped it and is dead in her backyard. The Prince, more concerned with finding Cinderella, waves her off and departs with one of the slippers, giving the other to the Baker and his wife. Jack, to the relief of his mother, returns with the magic harp. The Witch discovers that the new cow is not pure white; it is covered with flour. However, the Witch is able to bring Milky White back to life and instructs the Baker and his Wife to feed the items to her. Jack tries to milk her, but no milk comes. The Baker 's Wife admits that the hair is Rapunzel 's, and the Witch furiously explains that the magic will not work because the Witch has already touched Rapunzel 's hair, which is also why she had asked the Baker and his Wife to get the objects for her: she 's not allowed to touch any of the objects. The Mysterious Man tells the Baker to feed the hair - like corn silk to the cow. Now Milky White gives milk which is the potion. The Witch reveals that the Mysterious Man is the Baker 's father. The Witch drinks the potion, and suddenly the Mysterious Man falls dead, his reparation complete, the curse is broken, and the Witch is transformed into a beautiful young woman, reversing the effects of the curse of ugliness by which she was punished by her mother, because the Baker 's father stole the beans from her, regaining her youth and beauty.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Into_the_Woods&amp;oldid=808878266

Joseph: Eleventh son of Jacob. Obviously his father 's favourite, Joseph early on shows a talent for interpreting dreams and telling the future. This gets him into trouble with his brothers when he predicts his future will include ruling over the other eleven. However, it saves his life when in Egypt he correctly interprets Pharaoh 's dreams. In the end he has risen to a great position of power, but he still forgives his brothers and brings his family to Egypt to partake of the bounty he has accumulated there. Ishmaelites: Men of the desert, they buy Joseph as a slave, take him to Egypt, and sell him to Potiphar.

Signed number representations|1124878605600980385|which method of representation has two representations for 0|`` sign and magnitude '' representation.|This representation is also called `` sign -- magnitude '' or `` sign and magnitude '' representation. In this approach, the problem of representing a number 's sign can be to allocate one sign bit to represent the sign: setting that bit ( often the most significant bit ) to 0 is for a positive number or positive zero, and setting it to 1 is for a negative number or negative zero. The remaining bits in the number indicate the magnitude ( or absolute value ). Hence, in a byte with only seven bits ( apart from the sign bit ), the magnitude can range from 0000000 ( 0 ) to 1111111 ( 127 ). Thus numbers ranging from − 127 to + 127 can be represented once the sign bit ( the eighth bit ) is added. For example, − 43 encoded in an eight - bit byte is 10101011 while 43 is 00101011. A consequence of using signed magnitude representation is that there are two ways to represent zero, 00000000 ( 0 ) and 10000000 ( − 0 ).|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Signed_number_representations&amp;oldid=844813835

The range of signed numbers using ones ' complement is represented by − ( 2 − 1 ) to ( 2 − 1 ) and ± 0. A conventional eight - bit byte is − 127 to + 127 with zero being either 00000000 ( + 0 ) or 11111111 ( − 0 ).|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Signed_number_representations&amp;oldid=807241697

Stardust used a collector array made of low - density aerogel ( 99 % of which is empty space ), which has about 1 / 1000 of the density of glass. This permits the ability to collect the cometary particles without damaging them due to high impact velocities. Particle collisions with even slightly porous solid collectors would result in destruction of those particles and damage to the collection apparatus.

You've Come a Long Way, Baby|423497202066080963|who is the guy on the cover of you've come a long way baby||The title You 've Come a Long Way, Baby was derived from a marketing slogan for Virginia Slims cigarettes. Conceived by Red Design, the album 's primary cover art features an obese young man dressed in a T - shirt bearing the words `` I 'm # 1 so why try harder '' while holding a cigarette in his left hand. The original photograph was taken at the 1983 Fat People 's Festival in Danville, Virginia and provided by the Rex Features photo library. Despite a series of enquiries, the man has not been identified. Additional photography for the You 've Come a Long Way, Baby liner notes was provided by Simon Thornton. The cover image was changed in North America to an image of shelves stacked with records.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=You%27ve_Come_a_Long_Way,_Baby&amp;oldid=866408213

The Marshall Tucker Band|5577162469356788824|where did the marshall tucker band get their name|a Spartanburg - area blind piano tuner.|The `` Marshall Tucker '' in the band 's name does not refer to a band member, but rather a Spartanburg - area blind piano tuner. While the band was discussing possible band names one evening in an old warehouse they had rented for rehearsal space, someone noticed that the warehouse 's door key had the name `` Marshall Tucker '' inscribed on it, and suggested they call themselves `` The Marshall Tucker Band, '' not realizing it referred to an actual person. It later came to light that Marshall Tucker, the blind piano tuner, had rented the space before the band, and his name was inscribed on the key. Music historian Joel Whitburn erroneously attributes `` Marshall Tucker '' to the owner of the band 's rehearsal hall in his book, Top Pop Singles, 1955 - 2002.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=The_Marshall_Tucker_Band&amp;oldid=858625597

Planets beyond Neptune|7218349169257709185|which term is described as small icy bodies that orbit the sun just beyond neptune ​|dwarf planets,|Clyde Tombaugh 's discovery of Pluto in 1930 appeared to validate Lowell 's hypothesis, and Pluto was officially named the ninth planet. In 1978, Pluto was conclusively determined to be too small for its gravity to affect the giant planets, resulting in a brief search for a tenth planet. The search was largely abandoned in the early 1990s, when a study of measurements made by the Voyager 2 spacecraft found that the irregularities observed in Uranus 's orbit were due to a slight overestimation of Neptune 's mass. After 1992, the discovery of numerous small icy objects with similar or even wider orbits than Pluto led to a debate over whether Pluto should remain a planet, or whether it and its neighbours should, like the asteroids, be given their own separate classification. Although a number of the larger members of this group were initially described as planets, in 2006 the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) reclassified Pluto and its largest neighbours as dwarf planets, leaving Neptune the farthest known planet in the Solar System.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Planets_beyond_Neptune&amp;oldid=862222132

Grand Prix motorcycle racing|7552675386463033670|what does flag to flag mean in motogp||In 2005, a flag - to - flag rule for MotoGP was introduced. Previously, if a race started dry and rain fell, officials could red - flag ( stop ) the race and either restart or resume on ' wet ' tyres. Now, when rain falls, a white flag is shown, indicating that riders can pit to swap the motorcycle on which they started the race for an identical one, as long as the tyres are different ( that is, intermediates or slicks instead of wets ) ( 1 ). Besides different tyres, the wet - weather bikes have steel brake rotors and different brake pads instead of the carbon discs and pads used on the ' dry ' bikes. This is because the carbon brakes need to be very hot to function properly, and the water cools them too much. The suspension is also ' softened ' up somewhat for the wet weather.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing&amp;oldid=800911873

Mother Jones has questioned the membership numbers published by the NRA. They say that in 2008, for example, the organization claimed both 3 million and 4.3 million members. Journalist Osha Gray Davidson suggested in 2000 that many deceased `` life members '' are kept on the books in order to inflate the membership rolls. A 2017 Pew Research Center Study found that more than 14 million Americans consider themselves NRA members, above the real membership number of 5 million. This may be attributed to the fact that the NRA has millions more of Americans who support them and will tell pollsters they are members, even when they are not. In other cases, it could be that their membership has lapsed and for others, they might consider a family member 's membership part of their own.

Military families passed on their shields to each generation as family heirlooms. The technical evolution and design of Spartan shields evolved from bashing and shield wall tactics, and were of such great importance in the Spartan army that while losing a sword and a spear was an exception, to lose a shield was a sign of disgrace. Not only does it protect the user, but it also protects the whole phalanx formation. To come home without the shield was the mark of a deserter; rhipsaspia or `` dropping the shield '', was a synonym for desertion in the field. Mothers bidding farewell to their sons would encourage them to come back with their shields, often saying goodbyes like `` Son, either with this or on this '' ( Ἢ τὰν ἢ ἐπὶ τᾶς ).|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Spartan_army&amp;oldid=802522071
Spartan army|-6776650308524360501|what was the spartan way of life designed to do||Tradition states that the semi-mythical Spartan legislator Lycurgus first founded the iconic army. Referring to Sparta as having a `` wall of men, instead of bricks '', he proposed to reform Spartan society to develop a military - focused lifestyle in accordance with `` proper virtues '' such as equality for the male citizens, austerity, strength, and fitness. A Spartan male 's involvement with the army began in infancy when he was inspected by the Gerousia. Any baby judged weak or deformed was left at Mount Taygetus to die, since the world of the Spartans was no place for those who could not fend for themselves. ( The practice of discarding children at birth took place in Athens as well. ) Those deemed strong entered the agoge regime at the age of seven. Under the agoge the young boys or Spartiates underwent intense and rigorous military training. Their education focused primarily on cunning, sports and war tactics, but also included poetry, music, academics, and sometimes politics. Those who passed the agoge by the age of 30 achieved full Spartan citizenship.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Spartan_army&amp;oldid=852206651

Jet engine|-7496156848362787801|where does the thrust come from on a jet engine|internal combustion airbreathing|In common parlance, the term jet engine loosely refers to an internal combustion airbreathing jet engine. These typically feature a rotating air compressor powered by a turbine, with the leftover power providing thrust via a propelling nozzle -- this process is known as the Brayton thermodynamic cycle. Jet aircraft use such engines for long - distance travel. Early jet aircraft used turbojet engines which were relatively inefficient for subsonic flight. Modern subsonic jet aircraft usually use more complex high - bypass turbofan engines. These engines offer high speed and greater fuel efficiency than piston and propeller aeroengines over long distances. Some jet engines optimized for high speed applications ( ramjets and scramjets ) use the ram effect of the vehicle 's speed instead of a mechanical compressor.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Jet_engine&amp;oldid=854533136

Achaemenid Empire|-8020830805147721067|how did economic decline lead to the collapse of the achaemenid dynasty||Part of the cause of the Empire 's decline had been the heavy tax burden put upon the state, which eventually led to economic decline. An estimate of the tribute imposed on the subject nations was up to U.S. $180 M per year. This does not include the material goods and supplies that were supplied as taxes. After the high overhead of government -- the military, the bureaucracy, whatever the satraps could safely dip into the coffers for themselves -- this money went into the royal treasury. According to Diodorus, at Persepolis, Alexander III found some 180,000 Attic talents of silver besides the additional treasure the Macedonians were carrying that already had been seized in Damascus by Parmenion. This amounted to U.S. $2.7 B. On top of this, Darius III had taken 8,000 talents with him on his flight to the north. Alexander put this static hoard back into the economy, and upon his death some 130,000 talents had been spent on the building of cities, dockyards, temples, and the payment of the troops, besides the ordinary government expenses. Additionally, one of the satraps, Harpalus, had made off to Greece with some 6,000 talents, which Athens used to rebuild its economy after seizing it during the struggles with the Corinthian League. Due to the flood of money from Alexander 's hoard entering Greece, however, a disruption in the economy occurred, in agriculture, banking, rents, the great increase in mercenary soldiers that cash allowed the wealthy, and an increase in piracy.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Achaemenid_Empire&amp;oldid=866279579

List of oldest universities in continuous operation|-8501969116325180206|when was the first university established in the world|1088 (|Year University Location Notes Original Current 1088 ( charter granted 1158 ) University of Bologna Kingdom of Italy, Holy Roman Empire Bologna, Italy The oldest university in the world. A university in the sense of a higher - learning, degree - awarding institute, the word university ( Latin: universitas ) having been coined at its foundation. It received, in 1158, from Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa the `` Authentica habita '', which settled the rules, rights and privileges of universities. 1096 -- 1167 ( charter granted in 1248 ) University of Oxford Kingdom of England Oxford, United Kingdom The oldest university in the English - speaking world: Oxford claims its founding ( ``... teaching existed... in some form... '' ) as early as 1096, and not later than 1167. Rashdall takes 1167 as the date when Oxford became a studium generale. In 1254, Pope Innocent IV granted Oxford a university charter by papal bull ( `` Querentes in agro '' ). Teaching was suspended in 1209 ( due to the town 's execution of two scholars ) and in 1355 ( due to the St. Scholastica Day riot ), but was continuous during the English Civil War ( 1642 -- 1651 ), when the University was Royalist. 1134 ( charter granted in 1218 ) University of Salamanca Kingdom of León Salamanca, Spain The oldest university in the Hispanic world. The university claims to have been founded by Alfonso IX of León in 1218 ( although James Trager 's People 's Chronology sets its foundation date as 1134 ), making it the third or fourth oldest university in continuous operation. It was the first European university to receive the title of `` University '' as such, which was granted by the King of Castile and León, Alfonso X, and the Pope in 1254. After being excluded from the University in 1852 by the Spanish government, the Faculties of Theology and Canon Law became the Pontifical University of Salamanca in 1940. 1209 ( charter granted in 1231 ) University of Cambridge Kingdom of England Cambridge, United Kingdom Founded by scholars leaving Oxford after a dispute caused by the execution of two scholars in 1209. Its royal charter was granted in 1231. The University takes 1209 as its official anniversary. Inspired the establishment of Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States, with the first college in the United States, Harvard University named after one of Cambridge University 's alumni, John Harvard. 1222 ( probably older ) University of Padua Lombard League Padua, Italy Founded by scholars and professors after leaving Bologna. 1224 ( 1258 ) University of Naples Federico II Kingdom of Sicily Naples, Italy The first public university, founded by Frederick II, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. The university moved to Salerno in 1253, and its return to Naples in 1258 is sometimes considered as a refoundation. It is considered to be the oldest public and state university in the world. 1290 University of Coimbra Kingdom of Portugal Coimbra, Portugal It began its existence in Lisbon with the name Studium Generale ( Estudo Geral ). Scientiae thesaurus mirabilis ( `` the admirable treasure of knowledge '' ), the royal charter announcing the institution of the University, was dated 1 March 1290, although efforts had been made since at least 1288 to create this first university in Portugal. Papal confirmation was also given in 1290 ( on 9 August of that year ), during the papacy of Pope Nicholas IV. 1290 University of Macerata Papal States Macerata, Italy Founded in 1290, possibly as a private law school rather than a university. Unknown whether this was in continuous operation, but there is evidence for a school ( without degree awarding powers ) in 1518. After petitions from the commune to the Pope from 1534, bull establishing a studium generale issued in 1540. By 1293 University of Valladolid Crown of Castile Valladolid, Spain Founded in the late 13th century ( first documentary evidence 1293 ), probably by the city. 1293 Complutense University of Madrid Crown of Castile Madrid, Spain The University of Alcalá was founded by King Sancho IV of Castile as Studium Generale in 1293 in Alcalá de Henares. It was granted a papal bull in 1499, and quickly gained international fame thanks to the patronage of Cardinal Cisneros and the production of the Complutensian Polyglot Bible in 1517, which is the basis for most current translations. The University moved to Madrid in 1836 by royal decree as Universidad Central. The Moyano Law of 1857 established Central as the sole university in Spain authorized to confer the title of Doctor on any scholar. This law remained in effect until 1969. In 1970, Universidad Central de Madrid changed its name to Universidad Complutense de Madrid, its present name. On the other side, the Universidad de Alcalá was restored in Alcalá de Henares in 1977. 1303 Sapienza University of Rome Papal States Rome, Italy Founded by Pope Boniface VIII, but became a state university in 1935. 1308 University of Perugia Papal States Perugia, Italy Attested by the Bull of Pope Clement V. 1321 University of Florence Republic of Florence Florence, Italy The University of Florence evolved from the Studium Generale, which was established by the Florentine Republic in 1321. The Studium was recognized by Pope Clement VI in 1349. 1343 University of Pisa Republic of Pisa Pisa, Italy It was formally founded on 3 September 1343 by an edict of Pope Clement VI, although there had been lectures on law in Pisa since the 11th century. Nowadays is one of the most important universities in Italy. 1348 Charles University of Prague Kingdom of Bohemia Prague, Czech Republic Three of four faculties closed in 1419, joined with Jesuit university and renamed Charles - Ferdinand University in 1652, split into German and Czech part in 1882, Czech branch closed during Nazi occupation ( 1939 -- 1945 ), German branch closed in 1945. 1357 University of Siena Republic of Siena Siena, Italy Claims to have been founded in 1240 by the Commune of Siena, although Rashdall dates the proclamation of the Studium to 1246, when Frederick II tried to place a ban on scholars travelling to Bologna. Was granted some exemptions from taxes by Pope Innocent II in 1252, but closed shortly after when the scholars returned to Bologna. Attempted revivals in 1275 and ( fed by further short - lived migrations of scholars from Bologna ) in 1321 and 1338 were unsuccessful. Gained an Imperial Bull in 1357 `` granting it de novo the ' privileges of a Studium Generale. ' '', but was not firmly established until `` ( i ) n 1408 a fresh grant of privileges was obtained from Pope Gregory XII ''. Closed temporarily in 1808 -- 1815 when Napoleonic forces occupied Tuscany. On 7 November 2015 the University celebrated its 775th anniversary. 1361 University of Pavia Domain of the House of Visconti Pavia, Italy Closed for short periods during the Italian Wars, Napoleonic wars, and Revolutions of 1848. 1364 Jagiellonian University Kingdom of Poland Kraków, Poland Founded by Casimir the Great under the name Studium Generale, and was commonly referred to as the Kraków Academy. The institution 's development stalled upon the king 's death in 1370; primarily due to a lack of funding. Without a permanent location; lectures were held across the city at various churches and in the Kraków Cathedral School. Further development again resumed in the 1390s, by the initiative of King Władysław Jagiełło and his wife Jadwiga of Poland; at which point the school became a fully functioning university with a permanent location. The university was forcibly shut down during the German Occupation of Poland ( 1939 -- 1945 ). The staff was deported to Nazi concentration camps, and many of its collections were deliberately destroyed by the occupying German authorities. Within a month after the liberation of the city, the university again re-opened; with some of the original pre-war staff who survived the occupation. 1365 University of Vienna Holy Roman Empire Vienna, Austria Modelled on the University of Paris. 1386 Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg Holy Roman Empire Heidelberg, Germany Founded by Rupert I, Elector Palatine.

The university closed in 1523, but would appear to have reopened by 1551, when there are records of a number of professors being appointed, including Johannes Aurifaber, David Chytraeus, and Johann Draconites ( de ). 1434 University of Catania Kingdom of Sicily Catania, Italy The oldest in Sicily. Founded by Alfonso V of Aragon. 1450 University of Barcelona Crown of Aragon Barcelona, Spain Founded by Alfonso V of Aragon as Estudi general de Barcelona after the unification of all university education.

Cleaveland oversaw the plan for what would become the modern downtown area, centered on Public Square, before returning home, never again to visit Ohio. The first settler in Cleaveland was Lorenzo Carter, who built a cabin on the banks of the Cuyahoga River. The Village of Cleaveland was incorporated on December 23, 1814. In spite of the nearby swampy lowlands and harsh winters, its waterfront location proved to be an advantage. The area began rapid growth after the 1832 completion of the Ohio and Erie Canal. This key link between the Ohio River and the Great Lakes connected the city to the Atlantic Ocean via the Erie Canal and later via the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River. Growth continued with added railroad links. Cleveland incorporated as a city in 1836.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Cleveland&amp;oldid=801488540

Civil forfeiture in the United States|3131120472606620983|laws that make something illegal without allowing a trial|Civil forfeiture in|Civil forfeiture in the United States, also called civil asset forfeiture or civil judicial forfeiture or occasionally civil seizure, is a controversial legal process in which law enforcement officers take assets from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal activity without necessarily charging the owners with wrongdoing. While civil procedure, as opposed to criminal procedure, generally involves a dispute between two private citizens, civil forfeiture involves a dispute between law enforcement and property such as a pile of cash or a house or a boat, such that the thing is suspected of being involved in a crime. To get back the seized property, owners must prove it was not involved in criminal activity. Sometimes it can mean a threat to seize property as well as the act of seizure itself. In 2015, Eric Holder ended `` adoptive forfeiture '' which occurred `` when a state or local law enforcement agency seizes property pursuant to state law and requests that a federal agency take the seized asset and forfeit it under federal law '' due to abuse. States proceeded to curtail the powers of police to seize assets, actions by the Justice Department in July 2017 have sought to reinstate police seizure powers to raise funding for federal agencies and local law enforcement.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States&amp;oldid=810865615

As a young midfielder, much was expected of Modrić; he was often dubbed `` the Croatian Cruyff ''. Modrić scored Croatia 's first goal of Euro 2008, converting a penalty in the fourth minute of their 1 -- 0 victory against Austria on 8 June 2008. It was the fastest penalty ever awarded and scored in European Championship history. He continued to impress at the tournament and was named UEFA Man of the Match in Croatia 's next game when they defeated one of the pre-tournament favourites and eventual finalists Germany. In the quarter - final against Turkey, Modrić took advantage of a mistake by veteran Turkish goalkeeper Rüştü Reçber, and crossed to teammate Ivan Klasnić for the first goal of the game with one minute of extra time remaining, but Semih Şentürk equalised for Turkey almost immediately. In the ensuing penalty shootout, Modrić 's kick was off - target and he failed to score the first penalty and Turkey won the shootout 3 -- 1. At the end of the competition, Modrić was included in the UEFA Team of the Tournament, becoming only the second Croatian to achieve this honour after Davor Šuker.|https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Luka_Modri%C4%87&amp;oldid=850577300
