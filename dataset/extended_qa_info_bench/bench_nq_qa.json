                "long_answer": "Part of the cause of the Empire 's decline had been the heavy tax burden put upon the state, which eventually led to economic decline. An estimate of the tribute imposed on the subject nations was up to U.S. $180 M per year. This does not include the material goods and supplies that were supplied as taxes. After the high overhead of government -- the military, the bureaucracy, whatever the satraps could safely dip into the coffers for themselves -- this money went into the royal treasury. According to Diodorus, at Persepolis, Alexander III found some 180,000 Attic talents of silver besides the additional treasure the Macedonians were carrying that already had been seized in Damascus by Parmenion. This amounted to U.S. $2.7 B. On top of this, Darius III had taken 8,000 talents with him on his flight to the north. Alexander put this static hoard back into the economy, and upon his death some 130,000 talents had been spent on the building of cities, dockyards, temples, and the payment of the troops, besides the ordinary government expenses. Additionally, one of the satraps, Harpalus, had made off to Greece with some 6,000 talents, which Athens used to rebuild its economy after seizing it during the struggles with the Corinthian League. Due to the flood of money from Alexander 's hoard entering Greece, however, a disruption in the economy occurred, in agriculture, banking, rents, the great increase in mercenary soldiers that cash allowed the wealthy, and an increase in piracy.",

Military families passed on their shields to each generation as family heirlooms. The technical evolution and design of Spartan shields evolved from bashing and shield wall tactics, and were of such great importance in the Spartan army that while losing a sword and a spear was an exception, to lose a shield was a sign of disgrace. Not only does it protect the user, but it also protects the whole phalanx formation. To come home without the shield was the mark of a deserter; rhipsaspia or `` dropping the shield '', was a synonym for desertion in the field. Mothers bidding farewell to their sons would encourage them to come back with their shields, often saying goodbyes like `` Son, either with this or on this '' ( \u1f2a \u03c4\u1f70\u03bd \u1f22 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u1fb6\u03c2 ).",

Referring to Sparta as having a `` wall of men, instead of bricks '', he proposed to reform Spartan society to develop a military - focused lifestyle in accordance with `` proper virtues '' such as equality for the male citizens, austerity, strength, and fitness. A Spartan male 's involvement with the army began in infancy when he was inspected by the Gerousia. Any baby judged weak or deformed was left at Mount Taygetus to die, since the world of the Spartans was no place for those who could not fend for themselves. ( The practice of discarding children at birth took place in Athens as well. ) Those deemed strong entered the agoge regime at the age of seven. Under the agoge the young boys or Spartiates underwent intense and rigorous military training. Their education focused primarily on cunning, sports and war tactics, but also included poetry, music, academics, and sometimes politics. Those who passed the agoge by the age of 30 achieved full Spartan citizenship.",

                "long_answer": "Because Garbo was suspicious and mistrustful of the media, and often at odds with MGM executives, she spurned Hollywood 's publicity rules. She was routinely referred to by the press as the `` Swedish Sphinx. '' Her reticence and fear of strangers perpetuated the mystery and mystique that she projected both on screen and in real life. MGM eventually capitalized on it, for it bolstered the image of the silent and reclusive woman of mystery. In spite of her strenuous efforts to avoid publicity, Garbo paradoxically became one of the twentieth century 's most publicized women in the world. She is closely associated with a line from Grand Hotel, one which the American Film Institute in 2005 voted the 30th-most memorable movie quote of all time, `` I want to be alone; I just want to be alone. '' The theme was a running gag that began during the period of her silent movies.",

She never signed autographs or answered fan mail, and rarely gave interviews. Nor did she ever appear at Oscar ceremonies, even when she was nominated. Her aversion to publicity and the press was undeniably genuine, and exasperating to the studio at first. In an interview in 1928, she explained that her desire for privacy began when she was a child, stating `` as early as I can remember, I have wanted to be alone. I detest crowds, do n't like many people. ''",

As a young midfielder, much was expected of Modri\u0107; he was often dubbed `` the Croatian Cruyff ''. Modri\u0107 scored Croatia 's first goal of Euro 2008, converting a penalty in the fourth minute of their 1 -- 0 victory against Austria on 8 June 2008. It was the fastest penalty ever awarded and scored in European Championship history. He continued to impress at the tournament and was named UEFA Man of the Match in Croatia 's next game when they defeated one of the pre-tournament favourites and eventual finalists Germany. In the quarter - final against Turkey, Modri\u0107 took advantage of a mistake by veteran Turkish goalkeeper R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Re\u00e7ber, and crossed to teammate Ivan Klasni\u0107 for the first goal of the game with one minute of extra time remaining, but Semih \u015eent\u00fcrk equalised for Turkey almost immediately. In the ensuing penalty shootout, Modri\u0107 's kick was off - target and he failed to score the first penalty and Turkey won the shootout 3 -- 1. At the end of the competition, Modri\u0107 was included in the UEFA Team of the Tournament, becoming only the second Croatian to achieve this honour after Davor \u0160uker.",

                "long_answer": "If the population of interest is approximately normally distributed, the standard deviation provides information on the proportion of observations above or below certain values. For example, the average height for adult men in the United States is about 70 inches ( 177.8 cm ), with a standard deviation of around 3 inches ( 7.62 cm ). This means that most men ( about 68 %, assuming a normal distribution ) have a height within 3 inches ( 7.62 cm ) of the mean ( 67 -- 73 inches ( 170.18 -- 185.42 cm ) ) -- one standard deviation -- and almost all men ( about 95 % ) have a height within 6 inches ( 15.24 cm ) of the mean ( 64 -- 76 inches ( 162.56 -- 193.04 cm ) ) -- two standard deviations. If the standard deviation were zero, then all men would be exactly 70 inches ( 177.8 cm ) tall. If the standard deviation were 20 inches ( 50.8 cm ), then men would have much more variable heights, with a typical range of about 50 -- 90 inches ( 127 -- 228.6 cm ). Three standard deviations account for 99.7 % of the sample population being studied, assuming the distribution is normal ( bell - shaped ). ( See the 68 - 95 - 99.7 rule, or the empirical rule, for more information. )",

                "long_answer": "In addition to expressing the variability of a population, the standard deviation is commonly used to measure confidence in statistical conclusions. For example, the margin of error in polling data is determined by calculating the expected standard deviation in the results if the same poll were to be conducted multiple times. This derivation of a standard deviation is often called the `` standard error '' of the estimate or `` standard error of the mean '' when referring to a mean. It is computed as the standard deviation of all the means that would be computed from that population if an infinite number of samples were drawn and a mean for each sample were computed. It is very important to note that the standard deviation of a population and the standard error of a statistic derived from that population ( such as the mean ) are quite different but related ( related by the inverse of the square root of the number of observations ). The reported margin of error of a poll is computed from the standard error of the mean ( or alternatively from the product of the standard deviation of the population and the inverse of the square root of the sample size, which is the same thing ) and is typically about twice the standard deviation -- the half - width of a 95 percent confidence interval. In science, researchers commonly report the standard deviation of experimental data, and only effects that fall much farther than two standard deviations away from what would have been expected are considered statistically significant -- normal random error or variation in the measurements is in this way distinguished from likely genuine effects or associations. The standard deviation is also important in finance, where the standard deviation on the rate of return on an investment is a measure of the volatility of the investment.",

During the 19th century, Australian football competition adopted the approach that the team on top of the ladder at the end of the home - and - away series was declared the premiers. However, the fledgling VFL decided that a finals series played between the top four teams at the end of the season would generate more interest and gate money. For 1897, the VFL scheduled a round robin tournament whereby the top four played each other once and the team that won the most matches was declared the winner.",

In August 1990, his manager, two of his roadies and his friend and fellow musician Stevie Ray Vaughan were killed in a helicopter accident. Seven months later, on March 20, 1991, Clapton 's 4 - year - old son Conor died after falling from the 53rd - floor window of his mother 's friend 's New York City apartment. He landed on the roof of an adjacent four - story building. After isolating himself for a period, Clapton began working again, writing music for a movie about drug addiction called Rush. Clapton dealt with the grief of his son 's death by co-writing `` Tears in Heaven '' with Will Jennings. Shortly after his single was released, he went on to the MTV Unplugged series and recorded a new version of the song. Unplugged topped charts and was nominated for nine Grammy Awards the year it was released. Clapton made numerous public service announcements to raise awareness for childproofing windows and staircases.",

These auditions are held in theaters in various cities nationally and are later televised. Judges may individually register their disapproval of an act by pressing a red buzzer, which lights up their corresponding X above the stage. Any performer who receives X 's ( 3 from season 1 - 7, or 4 from season 8 - ) from the judges must stop performing and is eliminated. Since season three ( 2008 ), large audiences have also been a factor in the judging process, as their reaction to an act 's performance may swing or influence a judge 's vote. If an act receives three or more `` yes '' votes, they advance to the next round of competition. However, in the majority of seasons, several acts do not perform in the second round and are immediately sent home by the judges without a second performance. Golden",

The comet and Earth were on opposite sides of the Sun in February 1986, creating the worst viewing circumstances for Earth observers for the last 2,000 years. Halley 's closest approach was 0.42 AU. Additionally, with increased light pollution from urbanization, many people failed to even see the comet. It was possible to observe it in areas outside of cities with the help of binoculars. Further, the comet appeared brightest when it was almost invisible from the northern hemisphere in March and April. Halley 's approach was first detected by astronomers David Jewitt and G. Edward Danielson on 16 October 1982 using the 5.1 m Hale telescope at Mount Palomar and a CCD camera. The first person to visually observe the comet on its 1986 return was amateur astronomer Stephen James O'Meara on 24 January 1985. O'Meara used a home - built 24 - inch telescope on top of Mauna Kea to detect the magnitude 19.6 comet. On 8 November 1985, Stephen Edberg ( then serving as the Coordinator for Amateur Observations at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ) and Charles Morris were the first to observe Halley 's Comet with the naked eye in its 1986 apparition.",

                "long_answer": "Halley 's orbital period has varied between 74 -- 79 years since 240 BC. Its orbit around the Sun is highly elliptical, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.967 ( with 0 being a circle and 1 being a parabolic trajectory ). The perihelion, the point in the comet 's orbit when it is nearest the Sun, is just 0.6 AU. This is between the orbits of Mercury and Venus. Its aphelion, or farthest distance from the Sun, is 35 AU ( roughly the distance of Pluto ). Unusual for an object in the Solar System, Halley 's orbit is retrograde; it orbits the Sun in the opposite direction to the planets, or, clockwise from above the Sun 's north pole. The orbit is inclined by 18 \u00b0 to the ecliptic, with much of it lying south of the ecliptic. ( Because it is retrograde, the true inclination is 162 \u00b0 ). Due to the retrograde orbit, it has one of the highest velocities relative to the Earth of any object in the Solar System. The 1910 passage was at a relative velocity of 70.56 km / s ( 157,838 mph or 254,016 km / h ). Because its orbit comes close to Earth 's in two places, Halley is associated with two meteor showers: the Eta Aquariids in early May, and the Orionids in late October. Halley is the parent body to the Orionids. Observations conducted around the time of Halley 's appearance in 1986 suggested that the comet could additionally perturb the Eta Aquarid meteor shower, although it might not be the parent of that shower.
